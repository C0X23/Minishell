# Questions to elucidate
### To-do
#### General
- Cut the project into pieces and agree on what we need to do

#### Organisational
- Scheduling meetings (2, 3 times a week ?)
- Organise tasks using Github projects

#### Technical
- Set up bash as default instead of zsh on our personal Macs
- Testing system for each "module"
	=> okay, if it doesn't take too much time to code them

### Done
- English language (comments, journaling, etc.): yes
- Github to public: yes
- Git branching: by feature, testing, main. Question: also fallan, cmegret branches ?
	=> to rediscuss when we cut the project down into pieces
- Find task system on github (or off github)
	=> Github Projects
- Environment: Linux ? (see subject: zsh ? bash ?)
	=> both on OS X, but need to set up bash as default instead of zsh (because minishell is tested against bash)
