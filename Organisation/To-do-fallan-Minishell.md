# Research
- Simple tokenizer:
	- Check if behavior is correct !!!
	- test it with various sequences, check if behavior is adequate
	- test for leaks
	- refactor for clarity of code (and to prevent issues)
		- Claude3.5 (in Double/VSCode):
		> Error Handling: The code could benefit from more robust error handling, especially for memory allocation failures.
		> Consider using more consistent naming conventions (some functions use snake_case, others use camelCase).
- Finish shell-functioning.md
- learn about abstract/concrete syntax trees and their implementation
- Go through token recognition process manually with a few examples
- Quick read of allowed functions to understand their purpose
- Readings:
	- man execve
	- man fork
- Re-read cmegret's pipex

# Other
- Environment set up: bash5.1.16 via macports/brew, UTM, ..

# Organisation
