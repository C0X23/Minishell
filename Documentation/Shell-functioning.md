# Shell functioning
How the shell works according to the [Shell Command Language definition](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html) and [Bash reference manual](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html), summarized, paraphrased and simplified for the Minishell project.

## 1. Reads input
### Input sources
(see Requirements.md -> to clarify)
- Shell reads lines
- From stdin
- From command line string (with `readline`)
- From a file

### Input characteristics
- length: unlimited

## 2. Tokenization
### 2.0. Tokenization summary
- Shell breaks input into tokens:
	- [**words**](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Definitions):
		> A sequence of characters treated as a unit by the shell. Words may not include unquoted metacharacters.
	- [**operators**](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Definitions):
    	> Operators contain at least one unquoted metacharacter, and are classified into:
		- **control operators**:
			> A token that performs a control function:
			- newline
			- `|` ([pipeline](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Pipelines))
			- (`&`, `|&`, `(`, `)` `=> don't implement`)
		- **redirection operators**:
			- `<` ([redirect input](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Redirecting-Input))
			- `>` ([redirect output](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Redirecting-Output))
			- `>>` ([redirect output in append mode](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Appending-Redirected-Output))
			- `<<` ([Here Documents](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Here-Documents))
			<br>From subject:
				> should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the delimiter is seen. However, it doesnâ€™t have to update the history!
			- `>|` : `=> implement ?`
			- (`<> >& <& <<<  &>> &> ` `=> don't implement`)
- [Metacharacters](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Definitions):
	> A character that, when unquoted, separates words:
	- space, tab, newline (whitespace)
	- `|` (pipe)
	- `<`, `>` (redirection)
	- (`&` , `;` , `(`, `)`. `=> don't implement`)
- Metacharacters and other special characters between quotes are not interpreted, except for `$` between double quotes

### 2.1. [Quoting rules](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Quoting)
- Tokenization follows the quoting rules:
	> Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell, including to prevent parameter expansion. Any shell metacharacter must be quoted if it is to represent itself.
- Quoting mechanisms:
	- Single quotes `'`:
		- Preserves the literal value of each character within the quotes
		- A single quote may not occur between single quotes
	- Double quotes `"`:
		- Preserves the literal value of all characters within the quotes, except `$`
		- A double quote may not occur between double quotes
		<br>(n.b.: because "A double quote may be quoted within double quotes by preceding it with a backslash." `=> don't implement backslash`)
	- Examples:
	```bash
	bash-3.2$ VAR=2
	bash-3.2$ echo VAR
	VAR
	bash-3.2$ echo $VAR
	2
	bash-3.2$ echo "$VAR"
	2
	bash-3.2$ echo '$VAR'
	$VAR
	bash-3.2$ echo "'$VAR'"
	'2'
	bash-3.2$ echo '"$VAR"'
	"$VAR"
	bash-3.2$ echo "'"$VAR"'"
	'2'
	bash-3.2$ echo ""'"$VAR"'""
	"$VAR"
	bash-3.2$ echo """'"$VAR"'"""
	'2'
	bash-3.2$ echo """"'"$VAR"'""""
	"$VAR"
	bash-3.2$ echo '"""'"$VAR"'"""'
	"""2"""
	bash-3.2$ echo '""''"$VAR'""'"'
	"""$VAR"
	bash-3.2$ echo '"'"'"'"$VAR'""'"'"'"
	"'"$VAR"'
	```

	- Manual decomposition:
	```bash
	bash-3.2$ echo "'$VAR'"
	'2'
	```
	=> Between double quotes, so parameter expanded

	```bash
	bash-3.2$ echo '"$VAR"'
	"$VAR"
	```
	=> Between double quotes, so should be expanded, but all this is between single quotes, thus literal value of each character, including the double quotes

	```bash
	bash-3.2$ echo "'"$VAR"'"
	'2'
	```
	=> From left to right:
	1. `"'"` => `'`
	2. `$VAR` => `2`
	3. `"'"` => `'`

	```bash
	bash-3.2$ echo ""'"$VAR"'""
	"$VAR"
	```
	=> From left to right:
	1. `""` => {}
	2. `'"$VAR"'` => `"$VAR"`
	3. `""` => {}

	```bash
	bash-3.2$ echo '"'"'"'"$VAR'""'"'"'"
	"'"$VAR"'
	```
	=> From left to right:
	1. `'"'` => `"`
	2. `"'"` => `'`
	3. `'"$VAR'` => `"$VAR`
	4. `""` => {}
	5. `'"'` => `"`
	6. `"'"` => `'`

### 2.2. Token classification
#### 2.2.1. Here-documents processing
IF
- an **io_here** token has been recognized by the grammar

=> one or more of the subsequent lines immediately following the next NEWLINE token form the body of one of more here-documents<br>
=> the here-document(s) are parsed according to the [rules of Here-Document](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_07_04)
#### 2.2.2. [Ordinary token recognition](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_03)
How to delimit tokens:<br>
- apply the first applicable rule below to the next character in the input
- the token shall be from the current position in the input until a token is delimited according to one of the rules below
- the characters forming the token are exactly those in the input, including any quoting characters.
- if is indicated that a token is delimited, and no characters have been included in a token, processing shall continue until an actual token is delimited. `=>?`

	=> Copilot:
	<br>Short:
	> If a delimiter (like a space or newline) is encountered before any characters are read into a token, it's not considered a token. The shell continues reading until it forms a valid token with one or more characters.
	
	<br>Long:
	> It refers to the situation where the shell recognizes a token delimiter (like a space, newline, or operator), but there are no characters that have been read into the current token.

	> If the shell encounters a delimiter (like a space or a newline) before it has read any characters into the current token, it doesn't consider that an actual token. Instead, it continues reading characters until it forms a valid token (i.e., until it encounters another delimiter after having read one or more characters).

	> For example, `echo		 hello`: &emsp;(n.b.: `echo<space><tab>hello`)

	> Here, there are multiple spaces between `echo` and `hello`. When the shell reads the first space after `echo`, it recognizes that `echo` is a token. Then it encounters the additional spaces. According to the rule you're asking about, these spaces don't form a new token because they're not followed by any non-space characters. Instead, the shell continues reading characters until it encounters `hello`, which it recognizes as the next token.

<br>**Rules**:
#### Tokenization functions requirements
Based on the rules below, here are some requirements for our tokenization functions:
- Token status: is there a current token ?
- Usage of the previous character : word or operator token ?
- Quoting status : is current character quoted or not ?
- Delimitation of token to previous character

##### 2.2.2.1. End of input
IF 
- end of input is recognized

AND	EITHER:
- there is a current token

=> delimit the current token

OR:
- there is no current token

=> return the end-of-input indicator as the token `=> return {EOF} token ?`

##### 2.2.2.2. Continued operator token and current character usable
IF
- previous character used as part of an operator
- current character can be used with the previous characterS to form an operator
- current character not quoted

=> use character as part of that (operator) token
<br>e.g.: previous character is `>`, current character is `>` => add it to `>>`

##### 2.2.2.3. Continued operator token and current character not usable
IF
- previous character used as part of an operator
- current character cannot be used with the current characters to form an operator

=> delimit the operator containing the previous character

##### 2.2.2.4. Quotes
IF
- the current character is single-quote `'` or double-quote `"`
- the current character is not quoted

=> affects quoting for subsequent characters up to the end of the quoted text (see [Quoting rules](#21-quoting-rules))<br>
=> During token recognition, no substitutions shall be actually performed, and the result token shall contain exactly the characters that appear in the input (except for <newline> joining `=> ?`), unmodified, including any embedded or enclosing quotes or substitution operators, between the quotation mark and the end of the quoted text.
=> The token shall not be delimited by the end of the quoted field.

##### 2.2.2.5. Parameter expansion (`$`)
IF
- the current character is an unquoted `$`

=> identify introductory sequence :
- `$` : see [parameter expansion (SCL)](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_02) **=> implement partially**
- `$?`
> Expands to the decimal exit status of the most recently executed foreground pipeline.
[Bash reference manual - Special parameters](https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Special-Parameters)

=> read sufficient input to determine the end of the unit to be expanded (see [parameter expansion](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_06_02))<br>
=> recursion (nested $) **=> don't implement**<br>
=> The token shall not be delimited by the end of the substitution.

See Requirements.md#Metacharacter_handling

###### Parsing of $/Parameter Expansion rules according to cmegret & fallan
=> See ft_check_export (nb fallan: should be ft_check_expansion)

- When `$`, start
- if digit
	=> expand with empty string `char *str; str[0] = '\0' and skip the 2 characters (`$` + `digits`)
- if `?`, expand => call ft_expansion avec parameter 1
- while lowercase letter, uppercase letter, `_`, digits 0-9
	=> continue
- else
	=> if possible to expand to the previous character, expand
	=> else: don't expand, return to `$`
- if ` ` or `EOF`

###### Parameter expansion
> If parameter is not in braces `{}`, and is a name, the expansion shall use the longest valid name (see XBD Name), whether or not the variable represented by that name exists. Otherwise, the parameter is a single-character symbol, and behavior is unspecified if that character is neither a digit nor one of the special parameters (see Special Parameters).

IF
- a parameter expansion occurs inside double-quotes

=> Pathname expansion shall not be performed on the results of the expansion. (e.g. `VAR="ls /etc/*.conf" && echo $VAR` will not expand the `*`)

=> Field splitting shall not be performed on the results of the expansion.

##### 2.2.2.6. New operator token
IF
- the current character is unquoted
- the current character can be used as the first character of a new operator

=> delimit the current token, if any<br>
=> use the current character as the beginning of the next (operator) token

#### 2.2.2.7. Blank character
N.b.: a "blank" is a space or tab character. (cf. [Bash reference manual - Definitions](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Definitions))

IF
- the current character is an unquoted \<blank\>

=> delimit any token containing the previous character<br>
=> discard the current character

#### 2.2.2.8. Previous character part of a word
IF
- the previous character was part of a word

=> append the current character to that word

#### 2.2.2.9. Comment (`#`) `=> don't implement`
IF
- the current character is a `#`

=> discard as a comment the current character and all subsequent characters up to but not including the next \<newline\>

n.b.: see how zsh does it (doesn't interpret them in interactive mode) ([Stackexchange](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/405317))

#### 2.2.2.10 New word
=> use the current character as the start of a new word

After delimiting a token, the next step is to categorize it following the [Shell Grammar](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_10)


## 3. Shell Grammar
Rules for determining what a token is

### 3.1 Initial classification
Apply the following rules in order (if, else if, else if, else)
### 3.1.1 Newline
IF
- a newline is found

=> return the newline as token identifier NEWLINE

### 3.1.2 Operator
ELSE IF
- the token is an operator (n.b.: in our case redirections `>`, `<`, `>>`, `<<`, or a pipe `|`)

=> return the token identifier for that operator `=> ???`
>("If the token is an operator, the token identifier for that operator shall result")
=> does this mean `|` 

### 3.1.2 Operator
IF
- the string consists solely of digits and the delimiter character is `<` or `>`

=> return the token identifier IO_NUMBER

ELSE
=> return the token identifier TOKEN

N.b.: further distinction on TOKEN is context-dependent. The same TOKEN can be considered a WORD, a NAME, an ASSIGNMENT_WORD, or a reserved below from the below list. Some of the productions in the grammar below are annotated with a rule number from the following list. When a TOKEN

### 3.2. Shell grammar rules
How to classify tokens
1. If the token is an operator, the token identifier for that operator shall result
2. If the string consists solely of digits and the delimiter character is one of `<` or `>`, the token identifier IO_NUMBER shall be returned.
3. Else, the token identifier TOKEN results and further distinction depends on context (see rules below)

TOKEN identifiers:
- Operator token identifier:
> If the token is an operator, the token identifier for that operator shall result.
- WORD
- ASSIGNMENT_WORD
- NAME
- NEWLINE
- PIPELINE `|`
- INPUT_REDIRECT `<`
- OUTPUT_REDIRECT  `>`
- IO_NUMBER
- DGREAT `>>` (redirect output in append mode)
- DLESS `<<` (Here Documents)

Tokens are classified according to the following rules applied in order:
#### 3.2.3. Reserved word
#### 3.2.4. Redirection to or from filename
#### 3.2.5. Name
IF
- the token meets requirements for a name (see [definition](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_230))

- the token identifier is NAME

ELSE
- the token identifier is WORD
#### 3.2.7 Assignment preceding command name
a. IF
- the first word does not contain the character `=`

=> apply rule 3.1.

ELSE
=> apply rule b.
b. IF
- the token contains the equal sign character:
	- if it begins with `=`
		=> the token identifier is WORD
	- if all characters preceding '=' form a valid name (see [definition](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap03.html#tag_03_230))
		=> the token identifier is ASSIGNMENT_WORD (quoted characters cannot participate in forming a valid name)
	- else
		=> the token identifier is either ASSIGNMENT_WORD or WORD (unspecified)

#### 3.2.9. Body of function
When the token is exact



## Definitions
### Operator

> In the shell command language, either a control operator or a redirection operator.

### Control Operator
> In the shell command language, a token that performs a control function. It is one of the following symbols:

&   &&   (   )   ;   ;;   newline   |   ||

>The end-of-input indicator used internally by the shell is also considered a control operator.

ref: [POSIX.1-2017](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/V1_chap03.html#tag_03_260)

### Redirection

> In the shell command language, a method of associating files with the input or output of commands. 

### Redirection Operator

>In the shell command language, a token that performs a redirection function. It is one of the following symbols:

<     >     >|     <<     >>     <&     >&     <<-     <>
